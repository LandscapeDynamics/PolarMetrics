Description: Functions useful for data reduction of environmental
    variables. Output data quantify the features of each annual (or diel)
    cycle using a polar coordinate framework. Functions are generalized to work
    on any time series with cycles of any length (daily, annual, interannual),
    but were developed for improved interannual analysis of land surface
    phenology data (NDVI).
