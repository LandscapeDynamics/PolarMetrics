Description: Functions useful for analyzing seasonal patterns in environmental
    variables, that reduce the multitude of input values to a smaller set of
    seasonal metrics that quantify the features of each annual (or diel) cycle
    using a polar coordinate framework. Functions are generalized to work on any
    time series with cycles of any length (daily, annual, interannual), but were
    developed for improved interannual analysis of land surface phenology data
    (NDVI).
