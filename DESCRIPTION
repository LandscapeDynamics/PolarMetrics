Description: Polar coordinate based functions useful for analyzing seasonal
    patterns in environmental variables, which reduces the multitude of input values
    to a smaller set of seasonal metrics (e.g., length of season, seasonality)
    that quantify the features of each annual (or diel) cycle. Functions are
    generalized to work on any time series with cycles of any length (daily, annual,
    interannual), but were developed for improved interannual analysis of land
    surface phenology data (NDVI).
