PolarMetrics is an R library containing functions for analyzing seasonal
patterns in environmental time series. It can be used by itself on any data
or for pre-processing/data reduction, as with the "landat" R package and
"landat_scripts". To install in R you will first want to ensure you have
the devtools package installed.

# If you don't have it yet, install 'devtools':
install.packages('devtools')
# Now install PolarMetrics ('zoo' will install automatically if not present)
devtools::install_github('LandscapeDynamics/PolarMetrics')
# The 'xts' package is recommended (but not required):
install.packages('xts')
# Refer to the manual for useful demos. Then explore and enjoy!
