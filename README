PolarMetrics is an R package containing functions for analyzing seasonal
patterns in environmental time series. After downloading PolarMetrics
from GitHub you will first want to ensure you have the zoo library
installed. If not then install it from CRAN. It is recommended that you
install xts, though not required.

install.packages("zoo")
install.packages("xts")
# Now install PolarMetrics
install.packages("path2download/PolarMetrics-master/",
                 repos=NULL, type="source")
# Refer to the manual for usefual demos. Then explore and enjoy!
